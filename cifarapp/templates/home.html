    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Md Jafor Ali, and I'm passionate about machine learning and deep learning. One of my recent projects involves working with the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular dataset for image classification tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. These classes include objects like airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        My CNN model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, but I'm continually working to improve the model's performance. Machine learning is a fascinating field, and I'm excited to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible with deep learning algorithms.
